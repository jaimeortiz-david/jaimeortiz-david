I am a Galápagueño dedicated to preserving island ecosystems. For my doctorate, I will be studying the invasive earthworms in the Galapagos Islands, which together with invasive ants may be contributing to the spread of invasive plant populations. My goal is to understand the introduction history of invasive earthworms and their evolutive response to the hostile environment of the Galapagos and to the co-occurrence of other invasive species, using mainly phylogenetic tools.
